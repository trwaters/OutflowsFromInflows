## Simulations from Waters et al. (2019)

The animations below are part of [this paper](https://arxiv.org), which has been submitted for publication to MNRAS Letters.

The middle panels in the animations below show colormaps of pressure (in units of `p_0`, the reference pressure at the outer boundary) on a linear scale over the full domain.  The bottom panels zoom into the region within the Bondi radius and show instead log-scale plots of the azimuthal component of angular momentum in units of `R_s c`.
